# Implementation Plan: about-this-mac Information CLI

**Branch**: `001-mac-info-cli` | **Date**: 2026-06-03 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-mac-info-cli/spec.md`

## Summary

This is a **conformance plan** for an already-shipped feature, not a greenfield
build. `about-this-mac` v0.2.2 already implements the full CLI surface, six
output formats, macOS source gathering, and the public-format privacy boundary
described in the spec. The work this plan governs is therefore: (1) verify the
shipped implementation against each spec contract, and (2) close the two
regression-test gaps the clarification session surfaced — a negative privacy
assertion for the `public` format and an explicit non-macOS early-exit test.
No production behavior changes; the deliverable is documented conformance plus
guard tests so the baseline contract cannot silently regress.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.10+ (`requires-python = ">=3.10"` in `pyproject.toml`)

**Primary Dependencies**: PyYAML (runtime); pytest, pytest-cov, black, pylint,
mypy, types-PyYAML (dev). No new dependencies required.

**Storage**: None. Output goes to stdout or a `--output` file. The `reports/`
directory is gitignored and used only for local dogfood verification (never
committed — public repo, no real machine data).

**Testing**: pytest with coverage (`--cov=src/about_this_mac`), 50 existing test
functions across `tests/`. CI-parity gate: `uv sync --extra dev`, `just
fmt-check`, `just type-check`, `just lint`, pytest. CLI dogfood for changed
surfaces per CLAUDE.md.

**Target Platform**: macOS 11+ (Darwin). Non-macOS raises `SystemError`
(`hardware_info.py:83`), surfaced by `handle_error` as a non-zero exit.

**Project Type**: Single Python CLI package (`src/about_this_mac/`).

**Performance Goals**: No hard latency gate (spec SC-008). Runtime is dominated
by `system_profiler`/`sysctl` calls; the only performance invariant is "must not
hang" and "do not issue duplicate expensive system calls" (Constitution
Principle IV — gathering is separated from formatting).

**Constraints**: Graceful degradation under limited permissions (documented
unknown/empty values + hint); valid JSON/YAML output; `public` format must
exclude serial number, unique device identifiers, and network identifiers
(spec OC-004); color only on TTY text output respecting `NO_COLOR`/`TERM=dumb`/
`--no-color`/file output.

**Scale/Scope**: Single-user, single-invocation local diagnostic CLI.

**Unknowns**: None. All three clarification items (privacy breadth, exit-code
contract, performance gate) were resolved in the spec's Clarifications session
(2026-06-02). No `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` markers remain.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Initial evaluation (pre-Phase 0):**

- **CLI Contract** — **PASS**. No flags, formats, stdout/stderr split, or exit
  behavior change. Spec OC-001 records the existing surface verbatim from
  `cli.py`. No breaking change, so no migration path required.
- **macOS Source Truth and Privacy** — **PASS with one test gap**. All facts map
  to documented sources (spec OC-003, README "Data Sources"). The `public`
  formatter is allowlist-based (`formatting.py:606`) and emits only
  Device/Model/Release Date/Processor/Hard Drive/Memory — it never reads serial
  or network fields, so it satisfies the widened OC-004 boundary by construction.
  **Gap**: no negative test asserts serial/network absence in `public` output
  (`test_report.py:66` sets a serial but asserts only presence of other fields).
  Remediated in Phase 1 (guard test).
- **Test-First Quality** — **PASS**. The two new guard tests are written before
  any code is touched. Because the implementation already conforms, the privacy
  guard test is expected to pass on first run against current output; to honor
  red-green it is first asserted against a deliberately-leaky stub to prove the
  assertion can fail, then pointed at the real formatter. The non-macOS test
  monkeypatches `platform.system` to a non-Darwin value and asserts a non-zero
  exit.
- **Deep Modules** — **PASS**. No change to module boundaries. Gathering
  (`hardware/`, `battery/`), raw execution (`commands/raw.py`), formatting
  (`utils/formatting.py`), output handling (`output.py`), and dispatch (`cli.py`)
  stay separated. New tests live under `tests/` and introduce no pass-through
  wrappers and do not make formatters run system commands.
- **Human and Agent Operability** — **PASS**. Acceptance criteria, one-command
  verification, allowed side effects, evidence, and escalation are specified in
  quickstart.md and the spec's per-story Independent Tests.

**Post-Phase 1 re-evaluation:** PASS (unchanged). Design artifacts add only
documentation and two tests; no new abstractions, dependencies, or boundary
violations introduced. Complexity Tracking table is empty — no violations to
justify.

Files this feature **adds to** (test-only):

```text
tests/
├── commands/test_report.py      # ADD: negative privacy assertion for public format
└── test_cli.py                  # ADD: non-macOS early-exit exits non-zero
```

**Structure Decision**: Reuse all existing modules; touch only `tests/`. No new
source modules, packages, or helpers. This matches Constitution Principle IV
(reuse existing helpers before adding new ones) and the "smallest change that
solves the root cause" rule — the only real change is adding the two missing
guard tests; everything else is verification of shipped behavior.
